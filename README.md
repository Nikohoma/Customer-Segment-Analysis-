Project Overview

This project aims to segment customers based on their spending behavior and income. The process involved data cleaning, handling errors and aberrations, applying statistical methods to ensure uniformity, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns, and ultimately using machine learning algorithms for clustering.

1. Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is a critical first step in the data analysis pipeline. This process ensures that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and free of errors. The steps involved in data cleaning for this project included:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Techniques such as imputation and deletion were applied to address missing data points.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Correction**: Identified and corrected anomalies or errors in the dataset.
- **Outlier Treatment**: Statistical methods were employed to detect and handle outliers, ensuring they do not skew the analysis.
- **Standardization and Normalization**: Ensured uniformity in data by standardizing and normalizing numerical values where necessary.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is essential for understanding the underlying patterns and trends in the dataset. Various libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and PygWalker were utilized for this purpose. The EDA process included:

- **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of the data to identify patterns and trends.
  - **Histograms and Box Plots**: Used to understand the distribution of numerical variables and detect outliers.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Explored relationships between different variables.
  - **Heatmaps**: Analyzed correlations between variables.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to summarize the data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified and analyzed trends in customer spending behavior and income.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detected patterns that could be indicative of different customer segments.

### 3. Clustering

The final step involved applying machine learning algorithms to segment customers based on their spending behavior and income. The clustering process included:

- **Feature Selection**: Selected relevant features for clustering, focusing on spending behavior and income.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Chose appropriate clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) based on the data characteristics.
- **Model Training**: Trained the clustering models using the cleaned and processed dataset.
- **Evaluation and Validation**: Evaluated the performance of the clustering models using metrics such as silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index to ensure the segments were meaningful and well-defined.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified distinct customer segments and provided insights into each segment's characteristics.

### Conclusion

This project successfully segmented customers into meaningful groups based on their spending behavior and income. The comprehensive process of data cleaning, EDA, and clustering allowed for accurate and insightful customer segmentation, which can be used to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance business decision-making.
